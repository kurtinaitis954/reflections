How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-------------
Repository - Group of files that we would commit at once
A commit is a snapshot of all the files in a repository
git log --stats (nos da estadísticas de los cambios que se han realizado)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git
git log
git diff file1 file2

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. 
Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. 


git checkout [file name]  (para comprobar un commit antiguo)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

git init
